# uptyme
simple scripts, quirky name

There are two scripts in this repo (this could be a gist, oh well)
**uptime.sh** - When running will ping known DNS for uptime, logging each time
**gen_report.sh** - When run will generate a report from the logs from uptime.sh
**install.sh** - this will install the two scripts as cron jobs to be run :)
